As of September 2025 Kobo has moved to Instapaper. I will look at updating this repository in the future, but in the meantime, upgrading to an earlier version of the firmware will still work. You will also have to avoid automatic updates using this method. 

# Kobo E-Reader Omnivore to Pocket Proxy

This project aims to convert the Pocket App on the Kobo E-Reader, specifically the Kobo Clara model, into an [Omnivore](https://github.com/omnivore-app/omnivore/) reading device using Typescript, Node, and Express. The device utilizes the modified host file on the Kobo Clara, accessible via ssh on the Clara. It can be achieved by following the tutorial available at [https://yingtongli.me/blog/2018/07/30/kobo-telnet.html](https://yingtongli.me/blog/2018/07/30/kobo-telnet.html).

## How it works

This currently runs  within my local network, on a Raspberry Pi. By making changes to the Kobo Clara's host file, it acts as a proxy server that can redirect and intercept network requests from the e-reader. This allows us to intercept Pocket traffic, redirect it to Omnivore, and intercepts the archive. O

## Technology Used

- **Typescript:** The project is developed using Typescript, a typed superset of JavaScript, which offers improved tooling and code maintainability.
- **Node:** The project utilizes Node.js, a JavaScript runtime, to run the server-side code.
- **Express:** Express is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs.
